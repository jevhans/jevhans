## 👋 Hello, I'm Jeff!

- 🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm a Product Designer based in Vancouver, Canada.
- ✨ My design philosophy is to create with dialogue, conviction, and a dash of fun!
- 🎨 I love to learn and will opt for a DIY-attitude whenever I can.
- 💻 With coding and markup, I pride myself in consistency, readability and meaningful semantics.
- <s>👾 I'm on GitHub so you can view some of my HTML/CSS and JavaScript chops.</s> 
- jk, I built my portfolio on Webflow this time around.
- 🖌️ You can find my design work at [jevhans.ca](https://www.jevhans.ca/)
- 📧 Feel free to drop me a line at jevhans@icloud.com
