## 👋 Hello, I'm Jeff!

- 🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm a User Experience and Interface Designer based in Vancouver, BC.
- ✨ My design philosophy is to create with thoughtfulness, conviction, and a dash of fun!
- 🎨 I love to learn and will opt for a DIY-attitude whenever I can.
- 💻 With coding and markup, I pride myself in consistency, readability and meaningful semantics.
- 👾 I'm on GitHub so you can view some of my HTML/CSS and JavaScript chops.
- 🖌️ You can find my design work at [jevhans.ca](https://www.jevhans.ca/)
- 📧 Feel free to drop me a line at jevhans@icloud.com
